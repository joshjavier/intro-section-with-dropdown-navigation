## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshots

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) - static site generator

### What I learned

What really made me spend a lot of time on this was the mobile menu, specifically how to implement the different designs for mobile and desktop with the same HTML code. On top of that, I wanted to follow accessibility best practices for my solution, so I learned about common design patterns for slide-out menus and using `aria-expanded` to indicate the open state of a menu.

```html
<nav>
  <button
    aria-expanded="false"
    aria-controls="slideoutMenu"
  >
    <img
      src="/images/icon-menu.svg"
      alt=""
      aria-hidden="true"
      focusable="false"
    />
    <span class="visually-hidden">Open menu</span>
  </button>

  <div id="slideoutMenu" data-visible="false">
    ...
  </div>
</nav>
```

It took a while to wrap my head around all these concepts, and even though it's not really included in the challenge requirements, I wanted to do it anyway to build a good habit for other coding projects I'll do in the future.

One thing I should really avoid is trying to learn too many things at once. I used 11ty, a static site generator, for my solution, and even though I made it work, I wasn't really able to maximize its features. It just increased my cognitive load and distracted me from learning about the accessibility aspect of the challenge.

I also think I could polish my process to make it more efficient. Break problems into smaller pieces, and work on one small piece at a time to avoid overwhelm.

### Continued development

At one point I stopped caring about making my code dry and just making it *work*, so I'm sure there's lots of opportunities to organize the code.

Since I also used 11ty, the challenge can also be broken down into smaller components to make it easier to maintain.

### Useful resources

- [Alt-texts: The Ultimate Guide](https://axesslab.com/alt-texts/) - This guide emphasizes the importance of **context** when writing alt text, among other best practices.

- [Write good Alt Text to describe images](https://accessibility.huit.harvard.edu/describe-content-images) - Another good resource that contains specific examples on using alt text for various image types like graphs, diagrams, images of text, etc.

- [Menus & Menu Buttons](https://inclusive-components.design/menus-menu-buttons/) - From Heydon Pickering's [Inclusive Components](https://inclusive-components.design/), this guide talks about accessibility considerations for faux menus and true menus, although it goes into slightly more detail on the latter. (The mobile menu for this challenge is a faux menu.)

- [Letâ€™s Focus on Slide-Out Navigation](https://knowbility.org/blog/2020/accessible-slide-menus/) - This guide is the closest to what I was trying to achieve, so it heavily inspired my implementation of the mobile menu.

- [Accessible and Keyboard-Friendly Hamburger Menu + Slide Out Navigation](https://www.impressivewebs.com/accessible-keyboard-friendly-hamburger-menu-slide-out-navigation/) - Another very good example of accessible slide-out navigation.

- [Breakpoint conditional JavaScript in vanilla JS](https://gomakethings.com/breakpoint-conditional-javascript-in-vanilla-js/) - This helped me implement the different behavior of dropdown menus - hover on desktop and by click on mobile menu.
